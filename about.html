  <h2>About Salmon Cookies of Seattle</h2>
    <p>As the founder of Salmon Cookies of Seattle, Pat Peterson, naturally is obsessed with Salmon. His fascination began back in 1976 while attending school at UC Santa Cruz.  Ever since a fateful protest that year against the inhumane treatment of coastal rockfish, Pat has vowed to forever forward be an ardent pescatarian.  That, and a staggering amount of hallucinogenic drugs helped birth the original idea for a fish-based confection.  And the Salmon Cookie dream was born.</p>

    <p>When Pat's not concocting a new delicious variety of his famed cookies, he likes to go hiking, fishing (naturally), and spending time with his family (shown above).  Family values are a strong component of Salmon Cookies of Seattle, and how better to illustrate that fact than to display the most recent artistic endeavor by his youngest daughter, Beatrice.  Above is her stylistic decoration of a Salmon Cookie at a family gathering this past Christmas.
